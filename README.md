<h2><b>Insights</b></h2>

**Primary KPI: Total Casualties (2021-2022)**

The comprehensive analysis reveals a total of 417,883 casualties over the years 2021 and 2022, underlining the critical need for strategic interventions in road safety.

**Primary KPIs: Casualties by Severity and Vehicle Type**

**Severity Breakdown:**

Fatal: 7,135
Serious: 59,312
Slight: 351,436

**Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type:**

Cars lead with a substantial 333,485 casualties, highlighting the imperative for targeted campaigns and monitoring for car drivers.
Secondary KPI: Casualties by Vehicle Type

**The diverse range of vehicles involved in accidents presents varying risks:**

Agricultural vehicle: 1,032
Cars: 333,485
Bus: 12,798
Van: 33,472
Motorcycle: 33,672
Other Item: 3,424
Monthly Trend Analysis (Casualties Comparison)

**Peak Months:** October and November consistently record the highest casualties in both years, necessitating heightened safety measures during these periods.

**Maximum Casualties by Road Type**

Single Carriageway roads, with 309.7K casualties, emerge as the focal point for safety upgrades and targeted interventions.

Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface

**Understanding casualty distribution based on road surface conditions unveils critical areas for improvement:**

Dry surfaces contribute significantly, with 279,445 casualties.
Wet surfaces record 115,261 casualties.
Frost conditions contribute to 22,781 casualties.

**Relation between Casualties by Area/Location**

The distinction between casualties in rural (162.0K) and urban (255.9K) areas indicates the need for tailored interventions to address location-specific risks.

**Relation between Casualties by Day/Night**

Daylight conditions witness the majority of casualties at 304,963, emphasizing the importance of safety interventions specific to daytime commuting.

These insights guide strategic recommendations for targeted safety measures, intervention planning, and resource allocation to enhance overall road safety.
